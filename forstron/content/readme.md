# What is this?

You are browsing a repository for main demo content XML files of [**Forstron** WordPress theme by WebMan](https://www.webmandesign.eu/portfolio/forstron-wordpress-theme/).


## Before you begin

1. Install and active the [**Forstron** WordPress theme](https://www.webmandesign.eu/portfolio/forstron-wordpress-theme/)
2. **Required plugins**: To allow all the demo content to be imported in whole, please install these plugins (they are required for [one-click demo content installation](#one-click-installation)):
    * [**WebMan Amplifier**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webman-amplifier/) - provides additional functionality, widgets, shortcodes, icon font and custom post types
    * [**Beaver Builder**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) - page builder plugin used to build the demo content (make sure the page builder is enabled for Pages and Projects post types - check this under **Settings &raquo; Page Builder &raquo; Post Types**)
    * [**Classic Widgets**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/) - Restores the previous WordPress widgets settings screens. Sidebars and widgets are not going to be used in fully block themes in the future, so if your website still uses sidebars, it is better to use this plugin to enable classic user interface.
3. **Optional plugins**: If you want to match your website exactly to [theme demo website](http://themedemos.webmandesign.eu/forstron/), please install also these plugins:
    * [*WP Subtitle*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-subtitle/) - to display page/post subtitles used in the demo content
    * [*NS Featured Posts*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ns-featured-posts/) - allows making posts featured, widening them on blog page
    * [*Jetpack*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) - demo content includes [tiled galleries](https://jetpack.me/support/tiled-galleries/) which are feature of this plugin ([how to install Jetpack?](https://jetpack.com/support/installing-jetpack/))
    * [*WP Featherlight*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-featherlight/) - for image zooming lightbox

Also, please understand that **demo images (and other media files) will be imported in low quality** and you should replace them with your own (properly copyrighted) images.


## One-click installation

**Forstron** theme supports one-click demo content installation via your WordPress dashboard.

Once you have installed and activated demo content required plugins as listed above, refer to [theme documentation](https://www.webmandesign.eu/manual/forstron/#demo-content) for information on how to run the one-click demo installation process.

*You do not need to download and install the files from this repository in that case!*


## Installation process

*These instructions are meant for manual installation only:*

1. Download the `.xml` file to your computer (read below for "How to download the files?")
2. Install the demo content XML file according to [WordPress Codex instructions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content#WordPress) (or [watch the video](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/a-beginners-guide-to-using-wordpress/lessons/wordpress-tools) on how to import WordPress XML files)
  > The original [**WordPress Importer** plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/) is pretty *outdated* and buggy. To eliminate the issues during theme demo content import I suggest using [a new version of the plugin](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer). Although it is *still in development*, it is perfectly usable and you can [**download it** from its Github repository](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer#how-do-i-use-it).
3. After the demo content is imported, set up your home and blog page under **Settings &raquo; Reading &raquo; "Front page displays"**:
    * Set "Front page" to "Welcome to Forstron" page
    * Set "Posts page" to "News" page
4. Now we need to assign navigational menus in **Appearance &raquo; Menus &raquo; Manage Locations** as follows:
    * Set "Main navigation" menu for "Primary Menu" location
    * Set "Footer menu" menu for "Footer Menu" location
    * Set "Social links" menu for "Social Links Menu" location
5. If you would like to set up widgets the way they are displayed on the [theme demo website](http://themedemos.webmandesign.eu/forstron/), use a procedure under [`widgets` subfolder](https://github.com/webmandesign/demo-content/tree/master/forstron/widgets)


## Important notes

*These instructions are meant for manual installation only:*

Please understand that due to how the WordPress works, the database IDs for imported content will differ from the actual IDs used on the theme demo website and thus you need to reset these to the correct values used in your website database (see the step 2 and 3 in "Installation process" above). This is normal in WordPress to prevent current existing content overwriting.


## How to download the files?

*These instructions are meant for manual installation only:*

*[Watch a video instructions.](https://vimeo.com/170576209)*

2. On top of the displayed file content you can see the **Raw** button. Right click the button with your mouse and select "Save link as..." from the options to download the actual file.
