5. After demo content is imported, we need to assign navigational menus in **Appearance &rarr; Menus &rarr; Manage Locations** as follows:  
  - Set "Main navigation" menu for "Primary Menu" location
  - Set "Social links" menu for "Social Links Menu" location
6. Now, after the demo content is imported, you can delete the One Click Demo Import plugin from your website. Your website should be set up as the theme demo website now.

In case you experience an issue during the one-click demo content import, please [read the online information article](https://ocdi.com/import-issues/).

## Required plugins

To allow all the demo content to be imported in whole, please install these plugins (they are required for [one-click demo content installation](#one-click-installation) too):

- [**Beaver Builder**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) - Page builder plugin used to build the demo content.
- [**Jetpack**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) - Demo content includes [tiled galleries](https://jetpack.me/support/tiled-galleries/) which are feature of this plugin. You can also enable social sharing buttons and related posts list.
- [**Classic Widgets**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/) - Restores the previous WordPress widgets settings screens. Sidebars and widgets are not going to be used in fully block themes in the future, so if your website still uses sidebars, it is better to use this plugin to enable classic user interface.

## Quality of imported media files

Please understand that **demo images (and other media files) will be imported in low quality** and you should replace them with your own (properly copyrighted) images.
