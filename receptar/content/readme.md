# What is this?

You are browsing a repository for main demo content XML files of [**Receptar** WordPress theme by WebMan](https://www.webmandesign.eu/portfolio/receptar-wordpress-theme/).


## Before you begin

1. Install and active the [**Receptar** WordPress theme](https://www.webmandesign.eu/portfolio/receptar-wordpress-theme/)
2. To allow all the demo content to be imported in whole, please install these plugins:
    * [Beaver Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/) - page builder plugin used to build the demo content
    * [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) - demo content includes [tiled galleries](https://jetpack.me/support/tiled-galleries/) which are feature of this plugin.

Also, please understand that **demo images (and other media files) will be imported in low quality** and you should replace them with your own (properly copyrighted) images.


## Installation process

1. Download the `.xml` file to your computer (read below for "How to download the files?")
2. Install the demo content XML file according to [WordPress Codex instructions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content#WordPress) (or [watch the video](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/a-beginners-guide-to-using-wordpress/lessons/wordpress-tools) on how to import WordPress XML files)
	> The original [**WordPress Importer** plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/) is pretty *outdated* and buggy. To eliminate the issues during theme demo content import I suggest using [a new version of the plugin](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer). Although it is *still in development*, it is perfectly usable and you can [**download it** from its Github repository](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer#how-do-i-use-it).
3. Now we need to assign navigational menus in **Appearance &raquo; Menus &raquo; Manage Locations** as follows:
    * Set "Main navigation" menu for "Primary Menu" location
    * Set "Social links" menu for "Social Links Menu" location


## Important notes

Please understand that due to how the WordPress works, the database IDs for imported content will differ from the actual IDs used on the theme demo website and thus you need to reset these to the correct values used in your website database (see the step 3 in "Installation process" above). This is normal in WordPress to prevent current existing content overwriting.

Also, please understand that demo images (and other media files) are of low quality and you should replace them with your own (properly copyrighted) images.


## How to download the files?
