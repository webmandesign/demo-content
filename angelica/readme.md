## Automatic theme demo content installation

This is a commercial theme and so it contains an automatic, true one-click theme demo installation functionality. Just install and activate the [**One Click Demo Import** plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/) in your WordPress website and navigate to **Appearance &rarr; Import Demo Data** to run the demo content import procedure.

Also, do not forget to enable the demo content [required plugins](#required-plugins) beforehand!

*(**Info**: Due to WordPress requirements no free theme provided via WordPress themes repository can contain automatic demo content installation functionality. So, such functionality is only available in commercial themes.)*  


## Manual theme demo content installation

The easiest way to install theme demo content is using **One Click Demo Import** plugin:

1. Install and activate the [**One Click Demo Import** plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/) in your WordPress website.
2. [Download ZIP package](https://github.com/webmandesign/demo-content/raw/master/angelica/angelica-theme-demo.zip) of theme demo files to your computer and unpack the files.
3. In your WordPress admin area navigate to **Appearance &rarr; Import Demo Data** and read the information. (Make sure you have all the demo content [required plugins](#required-plugins) installed and activated before proceeding with demo import.)
4. Complete the "Manual demo files upload" procedure:<br><br>

5. Now, after the demo content is imported, you can delete the One Click Demo Import plugin from your website. Your website should be set up as the theme demo website now.

In case you experience an issue during the one-click demo content import, please [read the online information article](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md).


## Required plugins

To allow all the demo content to be imported in whole, please install these plugins (they are required for [one-click demo content installation](#one-click-installation) too):

- [**WooCommerce**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) - provides e-commerce functionality.
- [**WooCommerce Menu Cart**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-menu-bar-cart/) - adds a shopping cart button in the navigation bar.
- [**WooSidebars**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woosidebars/) - hides sidebar on certain pages.
- [**Classic Widgets**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/) - Restores the previous WordPress widgets settings screens. Sidebars and widgets are not going to be used in fully block themes in the future, so if your website still uses sidebars, it is better to use this plugin to enable classic user interface.


## Optional plugins

If you want to match your website exactly to [the theme demo website](http://themedemos.webmandesign.eu/angelica/), please install also these plugins:

- [**Jetpack**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webman-amplifier/) - provides many additional features, such as social sharing buttons, visitor stats, testimonials post type, ([how to install Jetpack?](https://jetpack.com/support/installing-jetpack/)),
- [*Breadcrumbs NavXT*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/breadcrumb-navxt/) - for adding a perfect, SEO friendly [breadcrumbs navigation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_%28navigation%29) (see [theme documentation](https://webmandesign.github.io/docs/angelica/#breadcrumbs) for custom plugin setup),
- ...and you can use any other plugin you want. See [theme documentation](https://webmandesign.github.io/docs/angelica/#plugins-others) for information on some additional, tested and recommended plugins.
