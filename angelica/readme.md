## Automatic theme demo content installation

This is a commercial theme and so it contains an automatic, true one-click theme demo installation functionality. Just install and activate the [**One Click Demo Import** plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/) in your WordPress website and navigate to **Appearance &rarr; Import Demo Data** to run the demo content import procedure.

Also, do not forget to enable the demo content [required plugins](#required-plugins) beforehand!

*(**Info**: Due to WordPress requirements no free theme provided via WordPress themes repository can contain automatic demo content installation functionality. So, such functionality is only available in commercial themes.)*  


## Manual theme demo content installation

The easiest way to install theme demo content is using **One Click Demo Import** plugin:

1. Install and activate the [**One Click Demo Import** plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/) in your WordPress website.
2. [Download ZIP package](https://github.com/webmandesign/demo-content/raw/master/angelica/angelica-theme-demo.zip) of theme demo files to your computer and unpack the files.
3. In your WordPress admin area navigate to **Appearance &rarr; Import Demo Data** and read the information. (Make sure you have all the demo content [required plugins](#required-plugins) installed and activated before proceeding with demo import.)
4. Complete the "Manual demo files upload" procedure:<br><br>
