2. [Download ZIP package](https://github.com/webmandesign/demo-content/raw/master/modern/modern-theme-demo.zip) of theme demo files to your computer and unpack the files.
3. In your WordPress admin area navigate to **Appearance &rarr; Import Demo Data** and read the information. (Make sure you have all the demo content [required plugins](#required-plugins) installed and activated before proceeding with demo import.)
4. Complete the "Manual demo files upload" procedure:
