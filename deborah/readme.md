## Automatic theme demo content installation

This is a commercial theme and so it contains an automatic, true one-click theme demo installation functionality. Just install and activate the [**One Click Demo Import** plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/) in your WordPress website and navigate to **Appearance &rarr; Import Demo Data** to run the demo content import procedure.

Also, do not forget to enable the demo content [required plugins](#required-plugins) beforehand!

*(**Info**: Due to WordPress requirements no free theme provided via WordPress themes repository can contain automatic demo content installation functionality. So, such functionality is only available in commercial themes.)*  


## Manual theme demo content installation

The easiest way to install theme demo content is using **One Click Demo Import** plugin:

1. Install and activate the [**One Click Demo Import** plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/) in your WordPress website.
2. [Download ZIP package](https://github.com/webmandesign/demo-content/raw/master/deborah/deborah-theme-demo.zip) of theme demo files to your computer and unpack the files.
3. In your WordPress admin area navigate to **Appearance &rarr; Import Demo Data** and read the information. (Make sure you have all the demo content [required plugins](#required-plugins) installed and activated before proceeding with demo import.)
4. Complete the "Manual demo files upload" procedure:<br><br>

5. Now, after the demo content is imported, you can delete the One Click Demo Import plugin from your website. Your website should be set up as the theme demo website now.

In case you experience an issue during the one-click demo content import, please [read the online information article](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md).


## Required plugins
